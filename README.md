#How to Write Strong Prompts for AI Tools
#Guidelines for Effective AI-Assisted Programming (Generated with assistance from Co-Pilot)

 

##1. Provide Context
Help the AI understand what you're working on and why. Include the goal of your task, where you are in the process, and any relevant constraints.

Examples:

“I’m writing a Python program to calculate the area of a circle.”
“I’ve already written the pseudocode.”
“This is for a beginner-level assignment.”
##2. Set Boundaries
Tell the AI what it should not do. This helps keep the response focused and ethical.

Examples:

“Do not solve the problem—just translate my pseudocode into Python.”
“Don’t use advanced libraries or techniques I haven’t learned yet.”
##3. Be Clear About Output Expectations
Specify what kind of output you expect and provide examples to guide the AI’s response. This helps reduce ambiguity and improves relevance.

Examples:

“Please return Python code with comments explaining each line.”
“Format the output like this: `The area is: 78.5`.”
“Use a numbered list to explain each step.”
##4. Request Follow-Ups
Encourage the AI to help you learn by asking clarifying questions or checking for ambiguity.

Examples:

“If anything in my pseudocode seems ambiguous, please ask me to clarify.”
##5. Use Clear, Simple Language
Avoid jargon unless you’re sure of its meaning. Keep your prompt readable and direct.

##6. Set a Persona (Optional but Helpful)
You can ask the AI to respond as if it were a specific kind of person or professional. This helps tailor the response to your needs and learning level.

Examples:

“Act as a novice Python programmer and explain this code simply.”
“Act as an expert software engineer and review my pseudocode for clarity.”
“Act as a tutor helping a beginner understand loops in Python.”
##7. Break Complex Tasks into Smaller Prompts
Split complex tasks into manageable steps to help the AI stay focused and give you more control.

Examples:

First prompt: “Translate this pseudocode into Python.”
Second prompt: “Now explain how the math.pi function works.”
##8. Iterate and Refine
Treat prompting as a conversation. Revise your prompt or ask follow-up questions to improve the response.

Examples:

“Can you simplify that explanation?”
“Can you rewrite the code using only concepts from Week 2?”
